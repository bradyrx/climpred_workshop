# Install Python Environment

To install the proper pythong environment for this demo,
run `conda env update -f environment.yml`.

# How to Run Slides

- Install `rise` via `pip install rise` (or use the conda environment).
- Run `python scripts/rise_json.py` before running the notebooks for the first time
  to install the proper reveal.js theme.
- Open a `jupyter notebook` (this only works for notebooks and not jupyter lab).
- Click the "Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow" button at the top of the nottebook.
- Use `space` to move forward and `shift + space` to move backward.
